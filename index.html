                    <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> Set during the tumultuous Great Sengoku Period (1460s-1560s CE), a desperate clan member sought to gain supernatural powers by negotiating with demons sealed away by the legendary samurai Raiden Takeshi. His actions shattered the seal, unleashing demons that dominated and enslaved humanity, forcing teenagers to become curse samurai who gain demonic powers only to serve their leaders.</p>

Determined to find the culprit and avenge his fatherâ€™s death, Ryuji embarks on a perilous journey, holding onto a promise made to his childhood friend, with whom he shares a deep love.</p>
